### Reading Material
> The old saying “be careful what you wish for” may be an appropriate warning. The drive to achieve a particular goal can dangerously narrow one’s perspective and encourage the fantasy that success in one endeavor will solve all of life’s difficulties.

Those who propel themselves toward the achievement of one goal often find that their lives are worse once “success” is achieved than they were before.
