### Reading Material
> Sometimes it is necessary to challenge what people in authority claim to be true. Although some respect for authority is, no doubt, necessary in order for any group or organization to function, questioning the people in charge-even if they are experts or leaders in their fields-makes us better thinkers. It forces all concerned to defend old ideas and decisions and to consider new ones. Sometimes it can even correct old errors in thought and put an end to wrong actions.

    > -- Criss Jami
*   > There is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.

### The passage from [this website not accessible within the GFW](http://nothingbutnormalblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/questioning-authority.html)

> A traditional example is during the ___Age of Enlightenment___ when scientists challenged the authorities in their field.  Though contested at the time, the idea that the world is actually round and revolves around the sun—rather than flat and being the center of the universe—is now accepted.  The clash of science and religion has also been long standing.  Throughout Medieval times, monarchies in England, for example, worked to combine church and state.  The motives behind
> conquering lands and divorcing and executing wives ( ___like Henry XIII___ ) were always to gain more power.  Having the church on their sides justified their actions, as they could claim they had “divine right” to rule.  Translating the Bible became one way to question the authority of the king and the state.  Slowly, Bibles, along with other books, made their way into individuals’ homes, educating more people.  Even ___Jesus___, part of the Christian trinity, advocated rebelling and
> questioning authority by working on the Sabbath in front of the religious leaders of His time.

> Other examples of questioning authority range from ___colonization___ to the ___creation of democracies___.  ___The colonists___ who fled King George’s rule became revolutionaries and even fought a war against their previous country for what they believed was right.  ___Labeled rebels and law breakers, the Boston Tea Party participants___ denied the rule of the king and demanded taxation only with representation.  While the idea was completely novel, creating a democracy with a
> constitution and later a Bill of Rights, based off of the precedent of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1515, was a huge undertaking.  Here, a collective group of individuals had said ___a king shouldn’t necessarily have the entire right ot rule.___  The inclusion of citizens in political decisions has since led to revolutionary changes.  ___The United States___, while still a young country has been an example for other countries to always question political authority.

### Exapmles from movies and films

> In the famous TV show ___Person of Interest___, ___Harold Finch___, a computer genius who built a ___machine___ that can track all communications in the country, acted against the authority. After the ___911 incident___, the machine was demanded by the government to ___analysis the communications___ and find out ___potential terrorist attacks___. The machine was build with respecting people's privacy in mind, which means that no data will be directly accessable by any human. However, the machine is so
> powerful that it sees ___all potential crimes___, not only the "big deals" considered by the government. The government forced Harold to devide the crimes found by the machine into two lists: The ___relevent___ list, and the ___irrelevent___ list. The "irrelevent" list which consists of crimes not related to national security (mostly concerns people considered "irrelevent" by the government) is ignored by the government. Harold hired ___Mr. John Reese___, a formal CIA agent, to assist him in his mission to resist the government's decision by dealing with the crimed listed in the irrelevent list. With Harold's superiority in technology and John's skills in combat, they saved hunderds of lives. Although considered illegal, all of those lives could not be saved if Harold stayed in the government's ___comfort zone___ and ignored the ___irrlevent___ list. 

> In the ___Avatar___ movie by ___James Cameron___, by 2154, humans have severely depleted Earth's natural resources. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines for a valuable mineral – unobtanium – on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. ___Jake___, an ex-marine operator of the hybrids of human and Na'vi (the natives on Pandora), resisted the authority. In order to achieve ___maxium productivity___,
> the authority decided to wipe out the Na'vis. ___Jake___ resisted the action, and acted on the side of Na'vis. In his defy against the authority's ignorance of the ecosystem and lives on Pandora, he joined the rebel of Na'vis, and defeated the military force sent by the authority. He saved all of the creatures on the moon, and probably the entire moon for the ground would collapse if all the mines were removed.
