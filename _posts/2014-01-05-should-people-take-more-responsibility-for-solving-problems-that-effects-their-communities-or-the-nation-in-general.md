### Reading Material
> Many people believe that our government should do more to solve our problems. After all, how can one individual create more jobs or make roads safer or improve the schools or help to provide any of the other benefits that we have come to enjoy? And yet expecting that the government—rather than individuals—should always come up with the solution to society's ills may have made us less self-reliant, undermining our independence and self-sufficiency.

### Critical Thinking
1.  Martin Luther King was successful primarily because America was trying to win the propaganda side of the Cold War. He did ___not___ do it alone. He worked with lots of people Black and White.
2.  The problem that arises in any society that professes human rights is how to resolve problems that arise when rights conflict. A widely held definition of freedom is "the right to do what I want as long as it doesn't interfere with someone else's right." In one sense, it is not a bad definition. It recognizes that there are limits to one's rights.
3.  Why shouldn’t government force people to do x, prevent them from doing y, or tax them to support z, as long as these objectives are “in the public interest”? That mind-numbing phrase has been the cover for untold human suffering. The truth is that there is no such thing as “the public interest.” Only individual human beings have interests. When people talk about “the public interest,” what they really mean is that some members of the public want something, and they want it at the expense of others. If, for instance, you hear a politician say that his national health insurance program would be “in the public interest,” he means that he and the backers of his plan want it, perhaps believe it is good for everyone, and don’t care that many other people disagree.
4.  Consider the monopoly the government has conferred on itself in the delivery of first-class mail. Anyone who would like to peacefully contract with others to deliver certain kinds of written communications violates the law and faces prosecution and penalties for doing so. His liberty has been attacked so that the government’s postal workers won’t have to face competition. The government also has the arrogance to prescribe rules for the use of mailboxes. Even though my mailbox is on my property and I purchased it, federal regulations say that no one, but postal employees delivering mail, may put anything in it. I might prefer to allow others to put advertising in my mailbox rather than other places where they’re apt to blow away or get soaked, but big government says no.
    Or think about government licensing requirements. In many cities, no one is allowed to go into the business of transporting people without a license, and licenses are unobtainable. Those caught violating the law, transporting people who desire the service and are willing to pay for it, are subject to prosecution and penalties. Their liberty to engage in a peaceful, beneficial transaction is attacked.

### Examples from films
1.  > Robert dean is a mild-mannered lawyer who works in Washington D.C. He is on the trail of a kingpin named Pintero. Meanwhile, a politician named Thomas Reynolds is negotiating with Congressman Phillip Hammersley about a new surveillance system with satellites. But, Hammersley declines, that is when Reynolds had Hammersley killed, but this murder was caught on tape, and this person was being chased by Reynolds' team of NSA agents, the guy must ditch the tape, so he plants it on
    Dean (unbeknownst to Dean). Then, the NSA decides to get into Dean's life. That is when Dean's life began to fall apart all around him, with his wife and job both gone. Dean wants to find out what is going on. Then, he meets a man named "Brill" who tells him that Dean has something that the government wants. That is when Dean and Brill formulate a plan to get Dean's life back and turn the Tables on Reynolds.
    
    In relating to the recent uncovered program __PRISM__, the scenerio is probably happening right now.
    POINT: This is what happens when the government has exclusive control over the issues concerns the nation: abuse of power is created.
2.  In the TV show ___House of Cards___ The House Majority Whip ___Frank Underwood___ used multiple ways to control the Congress, and even in the impotant ___education bill___, he modified the bill -- not for the benificial of the teachers, which can be seen through an unethicly resolved strike of the teachers(framing a child's death on the union leader and forced the leader to "assult a congress) , but for his own interests. However, if such bill is not written by some "experts group" inside the government, this would be.....
